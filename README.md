ReadMe Folder Structure
The code structure for the Curabit Healthpod system should be modular, well-organized, and maintainable. This will facilitate collaboration among developers, simplify debugging, and allow for future expansion and improvements. A suggested code structure is as follows:
Project root folder
Contains configuration files, build scripts, and documentation.
Source folder (src)
Contains the main source code for the system, organized into subfolders for each major component.
a. HealthPods User Interface
Components, styles, and scripts related to the user interface.
b. Patient Facing App
Components, styles, and scripts for the patient-facing app.
c. Physician Portal
Components, styles, and scripts for the physician portal.
d. Curabit Medical AI Chatbot
Source code for the AI chatbot, including natural language processing and ML algorithms.
e. Curabit RTOS
Source code for the real-time operating system.
f. Blockchain Layer & NFT Integration
Source code for the blockchain layer, smart contracts, and NFT integration.
g. Curabit Coin Integration
Source code for the Curabit Coin integration and related payment systems.
h. Shared
Contains utility functions, shared components, and libraries used across multiple system components.
Test folder (test)
Contains unit, integration, and system tests for each component, organized into corresponding subfolders.
Resources folder (resources)
Contains static resources such as images, fonts, and configuration files.
Documentation folder (docs)
Contains project documentation, including user manuals, guides, and technical documents.
Build folder (build)
Contains build artifacts, compiled code, and other generated files.
This code structure should be accompanied by a robust version control system, such as Git, to manage code changes and facilitate collaboration among team members. Additionally, coding standards and conventions should be established and enforced to ensure consistency and maintainability across the project.
